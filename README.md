# P2
P2! Developed by Jessica(Optimization Lead), Jonathan (Visualization Lead), Justis (GitHub Admin/Owner), Patrick(Team Lead).

# Prompt
Create a Spark Application that process data(choose your data).

Size of data should be 2k and above,and a minimum 3 tables.

Your project  should involve useful analysis of data(Every concept of spark like rdd, dataframes, sql, dataset and optimization methods  and  persistence should be included). The Expected output is different trends that you have observed as part of data collectivley and how you can use these trends to make some useful decisions.

Should have admin and normal user access with password set in database along with Visualization  for out put 

Let the P2, have presentation with screen shots and practical demo.

# Trends
TODO Age trends: does age effect recklessness or fatality in general. Age as a driver vs age as a pedestrian.

TODO Overall fatality trends: Overall increase across all states? Did any states get better throughout any years?

TODO *Possibly out of scope
Regulate the weather data. Is regular weather data high just because regular weather is more common than rain for example?*

TODO Rural vs Urban: Isolate differences in trends across more Rural and more Urban states.

TODO Danger ratio: Ratio between death inside a vehicle versus outside the vehicle. Which are the most dangerous to drive, and which are the most dangerous to be around?

TODO Right On Red: Any differences between RightOnRed states and non-RightOnRed states

#THINGS WE GOTTA DO
TODO Every concept of spark like rdd, dataframes, sql, dataset and optimization methods  and  persistence should be included.
TODO Username and password implementation (MySQL or document in spark-warehouse)
